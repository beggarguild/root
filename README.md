<strong>Isaiah 53:1-5</strong>
<br>
Who hath believed our report?
<br>
and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
<br>
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant,
<br>
and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness;
<br>and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
<br>
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:
<br>
and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
<br>
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken,
<br>
smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
<br>
our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
<br>
And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit
<br>
of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fearof the LORD; And shall make him of
<br>
quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
<br>
neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
<br>
and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the
<br>
rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
<br>
And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins,
<br>
and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
